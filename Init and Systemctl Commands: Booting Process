RHEL 6 has 7 run levels(0-6), which uses INIT commands.
The difference between INIT and SYSTEMCTL commands lies in their syntax.

Commands for the Booting process:

# init 0 -> Poweroff
# init 1 -> Single user mode
# init 2 -> Multi-user mode without NFS(Network File System), thus cant share files from network
# init 3 -> Multi-user mode with NFS, thus can share files from the network
# init 4 -> unused mode as of now. No program assigned
# init 5 -> Graphical User mode
# init 6 -> Reboot

  OR

# systemctl poweroff  //poweroff or hibernate or reboot, can be used
# systemctl get-default  //To determine which target unit is used by default, run the following command: 
# systemctl isolate emergency.target  //Changes the current target
# systemctl set-default/isolate multi-user.target //booting into a multi-user target
# systemctl set-default/isolate graphical.target  //booting into a graphical target
