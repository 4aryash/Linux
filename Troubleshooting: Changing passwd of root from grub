# -> root user
$ -> other user

For RHEL, commands are as follows,

1)  In the Grub menu, select the kernel and press edit. The various kernels can be differentiated on the basis of their os names.

2)  When a command line interface opens up, scroll down to the "linuxX16" paragraph, and press the End key on the keyboard.

3)  Write the command at the end of the line.
    Command:  rd.break console=tty1

4)  Now, press ctrl+x and exit the command line interface.

5)  Now we must get the read and write permissions in the kernel, so that we can make changes in the shell.
    Command: #mount -o remount,rw /sysroot

6)  Now we must switch the shell by the command,
    Command: #chroot /sysroot

7)  Now the command line will switch to, we can now change the password from here
    sh-4.2# passwd
    
    New passwd: xyzRandomPassword123
    retype: xyzRandomPassword123      //click enter to set the passwd

8)  Command: sh-4.2# touch /.autorelabel
    This converts back the permissions to read only after restarting, and the permissions are set to the default SELinux policies.
    
9)  #exit   //exit the cmd line interface

10) #exit   //exit the grub
