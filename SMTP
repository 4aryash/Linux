Postfix is the application used to configure SMTP, for sending and receiving mails(without attachments).

When any mail is sent, it follows 4 basic steps,
    i) Mail User Agents(MUA)-   User(you) interacts with the application that is sending/receiving the mail.
    ii) Mail Submission Agents(MSA)-    Mail is sent from Client(You.gmail) to server(Gmail, Yahoo, etc).
    iii) Mail Transmission Agents(MTA)-   Mail is sent from the Server1(Gmail) to Server2(Gmail/Yahoo).
    iv) Mail Delivery Agents(MDA)-    Mail is sent from the Server2(Yahoo) to Client(xyz.yahoo).

Commands:
  a)Configure postfix in server pc(your pc)-
    #yum install postfix    //install postfix pkg in the system
    #vim /etc/postfix/main.cf   //configuration file for postfix
    
      myhostname  = yourServername.domainName.com
      mydomain    = domain.com
      
      myorigin    = $myhostname   //if this command is given, the client gets to know which system in the domain has sent the mail.
      #myorigin   = $mydomain   //here, the client will not know which system has sent the mail. Only domain is specified.
      
      inet_interfaces = all   //interacts and listens on all interfaces
      #inet_interfaces= $myhostname   //listens on only the host
      #inet_interfaces= $myhostname,localhost   //listens on both host machine and the homenetwork
      #inet_interfaces= localhost   //listens on only home network
      
      mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain, mail.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain, www.$mydomain
          //can send and receive mails through these servers
      
      relayhost = [desktop7.example.com]
        //The id through which the mail is going to be sent
        //Relayhost is a seperate gateway which acts as a path
        //Gateway can be the same system but relayhost is a seperate system acting like a gateway/path.
