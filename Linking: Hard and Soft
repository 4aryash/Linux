Links of existing Files and Directories can be created using two methods of HARD-LINK and SOFT-LINK.
Linking is similar to creating a shortcut of an application, for faster access, just like in windows.

Hard Link:
  *Creates links of only files and not directories.
  *Inode ID of a file and its link is same.
  *Cant create link in between partitions.
  *If the source file gets corrupted, the link file will not be affected and vice versa.
Soft Link:
  *Creates links of both files and directories.
  *Inode ID for a source and link files are different.
  *Can create links through different partitions or file systems.
  *If the source file gets corrupted, the link file will also be affected and vice versa.
  
Commands:
  #ln xyzFilename hardl   //creates a hardlinked file
  #ln -s xyzFilename softl  //creates a softlinked file
  
  #ln xyzDirname hardl    //creates an error. Can't hardlink a directory
  #ln -s xyzDirname softl //creates a softlinked dir
  
  #ls -i    //inode value of any file/dir
  
  #unlink hardl   //automatically removes link
  #unlink softl
