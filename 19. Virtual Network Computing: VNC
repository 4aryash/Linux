Notes:-
  These are the steps you need to follow to establish a VNC between a server(friend's system) and a client(your system).
  VNC-> Graphical && SSH-> Non graphical.
  VNC is done on a local network, similar to SSH.
  If connection is to be established on a non-local network, softwares like TeamViewer are good to go.
  PS: Anything after "#" is a command. Anything after "//" is a comment.

The default service port number of vnc is 5900+N,
where N is the number of nodes/network.



*****Commands to be executed on the server side/friend's system.*****

#yum install tigervnc tigervnc-server                               //command for rhel
#sudo apt-get install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-viewer    //command for debian

#cat /etc/sysconfig/vncservers  //default config file location

#cp vncserver@.service /etc/systemd/system/vncserver_student@:1.service
  //name of the original file changed and port number set to 1.
  //Create a copy of this original config file to another location, as we are setting up the vncserver for a single user.
  //We will be required to setup for many users, so the original file will be used.

#cd /newLocation
#vim vncservers
    //read the instructions and change the username to your user XYZ or root user, based on which one you want to give to the client(friend).
    //save and quit the vim editor

#systemctl enable vncserver_student@:1.service    //enabling the vnc service

#su user XYZ    //switching user to the given sudo apt-get install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-vieweruser, to set a vnc password required by the client.
#vncpasswd
#logout

#systemctl daemon-reload    //refreshing the processes

#systemctl restart vncserver_student@:1.service

#firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=vnc.server    //giving access of vnc server to the firewall
#firewall-cmd --reload
#firewall-cmd --list-all    //optional command. Shows all services allowed by the firewall.



*****Commands to be executed on the client side/your system.*****

#yum install tigervnc   //for rhel
#vncviewer
  //now, give the server ip or the username that was set.
  //example- 192.168.43.54:1, where 1 is the port number set.
